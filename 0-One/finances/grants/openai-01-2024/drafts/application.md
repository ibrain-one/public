How much funding are you requesting?

We generally expect to make grants between $100k-$2M.

(If you are a graduate student applying for the OpenAI Superalignment Fellowship, we default to our standard package of $75k stipend + $75k compute. In that case, you don't need to fill out the budget in more detail.)

In addition to your mainline budget, it can be helpful for you to give a lower and an upper bound (what are smaller/larger versions of the project we could fund?).
