Certainly! Moving back to a more structured approach, we can define each data level, starting with the serialized data received via websockets and moving up to tasks and actions, with their specific properties and characteristics. To avoid over-engineering, we'll define just what is necessary for clarity and function at each level.

Let's outline the details in a tabulated form:

### Data Definitions Table

|  **Data Level**  |  **Description**  |  **Properties**  |  **Type/Format**  | 
|----------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
 |  **Payload**  | Serialized data received through websockets. | N/A | String or binary data, JSON, XML, Protobuf, etc. |
  |  **Task**  | Deserialized data structured into a task with steps. | - Relationships<br>- Dependencies<br>- Schedule<br>- Priorities<br>- Requirements | Object:  `{ steps: Step[], relationships: [], dependencies: [], schedule: DateTime, priorities: number, requirements: [] }`  |
   |  **Step**  | An operational unit within a task representing an action. | - Intention<br>- Work<br>- Expected Result | Object:  `{ action: string, arguments: any, result: any }`  |

### Payload:

-   It's the data in its rawest form as received from the external sources.
-   This data is often in a format that's not readily usable by the system and needs to be processed or "unwrapped".

### Task:

-   A task is the intermediary form of the payload. It structures the raw data into a more systematic and usable form.
-   Tasks have metadata, which consists of relationships, dependencies, schedules, and priorities, which influences how they are processed.

### Step:

-   Steps are actionable items within a task.
-   Each step should have a clear intention (what needs to be done), work (the operational part of the action), and an expected result (the desired outcome upon the step's completion).

### Implementation Suggestion:

For the  **Payload**  level, you may just need a service that listens to websocket events and performs the initial parsing of data to determine the type of task it represents.

For the  **Task**  level, you could have a service or a set of functions that constructs task objects based on the payload data. This service would organize the data into tasks with readily usable steps according to properties like relationships and dependencies.

For the  **Step**  level, you might implement individual classes or functions that represent specific actions within the system. These would be executed, likely by some task processing engine, to accomplish the intended work and generate a result.
### Example Representation JSON for Task with Steps:

```json
{
  "taskId": "12345",
  "description": "This is an example task.",
  "schedule": "2021-05-01T14:00:00Z",
  "priority": 1,
  "requirements": ["req1", "req2"],
  "relationships": ["rel1", "rel2"],
  "dependencies": ["dep1", "dep2"],
  "steps": [
    {
      "action": "validateUser",
      "arguments": {"userId": "user1"},
      "result": null
    },
    {
      "action": "processPayment",
      "arguments": {"amount": 100.00, "currency": "USD"},
      "result": null
    }
  ]
}

```

This JSON represents a more sophisticated structure that would be typical of a Task composed of steps, with scheduling and prioritization metadata included. Each action within the steps can then be executed systematically by your task management system.

By defining these structures, you create a clear contract for how data should be handled at each level and ensure that the system components are aligned with these contracts, thus avoiding over-engineering by sticking only to necessitated design elements.
