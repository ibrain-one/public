## Swaggy Concern Overview

This document captures a discussion on a proposed system architecture designed to operate lightweight Docker containers for individual users. The architecture overview addresses potential concerns and outlines strategic solutions to make the system efficient and scalable.

**Lightweight Containers**
Containers are optimized to be minimalistic, hosting only the necessary components, significantly reducing the resource usage typically associated with containerized environments.

**Shared Resources**
Employing Docker's resource-sharing capabilities, resources like volumes, networks, and even base image layers can be efficiently utilized among containers.

**Simplified Complexity**
The microservices approach within each super tiny container simplifies the system's complexity, making it more manageable and scalable.

**Hot-Loaded Containers**
A strategy of keeping a pool of pre-warmed containers on standby will ensure minimal startup time, eliminating delays when users initiate sessions.

**Real-Time State Synchronization**
State is synchronously replicated to a central storage system, ensuring resilience and immediate recoverability in the event of a container failure.

**Cost Efficiency**
With containers designed to be light on resources and sharing common elements, the system can support a significant number of containers even on modest hardware, potentially offering substantial cost savings.

**Operational Overview**
- Users connect to the system, prompting a request for a new session within a pre-warmed Docker container.
- Containers include both frontend and backend components, serving an SPA and handling data internally.
- Real-time communication between the client and container services is managed via WebSockets.
- Continuous data synchronization with a central database ensures consistency and statefulness across sessions.
- System health and usage patterns are monitored through dedicated logging and monitoring services.

The architecture is designed with user isolation, rapid scalability, and high configurability in mind, addressing the needs of real-time, responsive applications while maintaining cost-effective operations.
