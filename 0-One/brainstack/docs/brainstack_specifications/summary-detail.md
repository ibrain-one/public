# Project Summary - AI-Assisted Ecosystem MVP

## Summary
The goal of the AI-Assisted Ecosystem MVP is to establish a collaborative environment where AI systems are integral team members working alongside humans. This project aims to streamline development processes by leveraging Brainstack's pub/sub Hub and state management systems. Emphasis is placed on creating real-time communication channels and a secure action token system to manage AI interactions with the development workflow. The MVP serves as the initial step towards a future where AI and human collaboration drive innovation.

## Details
