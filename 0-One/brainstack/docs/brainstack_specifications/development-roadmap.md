# Brain Stack Development Roadmap

## Phase 1: Initial Setup

### Milestone 1.1: Establish Project Infrastructure

- [ ] Set up version control repositories and branch strategies.
- [ ] Configure project management tools and workflows (e.g., issue trackers, Kanban boards).
- [ ] Define coding standards and review practices.

### Milestone 1.2: Scaffold Architectural Components

- [ ] Develop the foundational components: Bridge Server & Client, Data Transformation Service (DTS), and Pub/Sub Hub.
- [ ] Implement basic state management mechanics.
- [ ] Define initial events and data schemas.

### Milestone 1.3: Create Contributing Guidelines and Documentation

- [ ] Write initial developer documentation, including setup guides and architecture overviews.
- [ ] Document contributing process, including how to submit issues and pull requests.

## Phase 2: Minimum Viable Product (MVP)

### Milestone 2.1: Develop Core Functionality

- [ ] Finalize Router Service and Task Manager based on initial specifications.
- [ ] Create a sample micro-app to showcase the Brain Stack operations.
- [ ] Develop basic user interfaces powered by natural language processing (NLP) capabilities.

### Milestone 2.2: Testing and Quality Assurance

- [ ] Set up automated testing suites for unit, integration, and end-to-end tests.
- [ ] Conduct initial performance benchmarking and optimization.

### Milestone 2.3: MVP Launch

- [ ] Deploy the MVP internally for user testing and feedback.
- [ ] Document and address any issues identified during internal testing.

## Phase 3: Scaling

### Milestone 3.1: Infrastructure Enhancement

- [ ] Scale out the data layer and state management to handle increased load.
- [ ] Introduce load balancers and replication where necessary.
