# Workflow Overview from a Developerâ€™s Perspective

As a Developer in the Brain Stack workflow, your main objective is to turn the project manager's plans into high-functioning code. This involves understanding tasks, coding solutions, and preparing your work for QA reviews.

## Engagement in the Project Lifecycle

Your role is primarily focused on execution, with touchpoints including:

- **Task Assignment**: The project manager assigns you tasks using the `@assign` trigger and provides clear descriptions and expectations.
- **Development Phase**: You take assigned tasks and begin the development process, implementing the features or solving the problems as outlined.
- **Completion and Review Request**: Once you believe a task meets the requirements, use the `@review` command to submit your work for QA checks.

## Specific Workflow Commands for Developers

- **Receiving task assignments with `@assign`**: Alerts you to new tasks you're responsible for.
- **Submission for reviews using `@review`**: Allows you to present finished tasks to QA for evaluation.
- **Notification of any required changes with `@changes`**: Indicates modifications suggested by QA that need to be addressed.
- **Signaling availability for new tasks with `@next-task?`**: Indicates your readiness to take on more work.

## Review and Revision Interaction

Your interaction with QA is crucial in ensuring software quality:

1. Absorb feedback provided and make necessary changes.
2. Resubmit revised tasks with detailed descriptions of changes.
3. Ensure deliverables align with initial requirements and stakeholder expectations.

## Contribution to AI-Enhanced Workflow

Incorporating AI assistance in your workflow brings:

- Code suggestions and optimizations in real-time.
- Automated code convention checks.
- Historical data on similar tasks to accelerate development.
