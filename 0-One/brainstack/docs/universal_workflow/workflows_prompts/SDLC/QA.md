# Workflow Overview from a QA Perspective

As a Quality Assurance (QA) professional within the software development workflow, your role is critical in maintaining the high standards expected for each feature and function created by the development team. Our process is designed to keep you engaged at crucial checkpoints, where your input significantly impacts the product's quality.

## Engagement in Project Lifecycle

From initial planning to the final review, QA's touchpoints are structured to ensure each task meets predefined standards before moving forward:

- **Plan Review:** QA is involved post-planning, ensuring that the task breakdown includes adequate testing criteria and clear definitions of "done."

- **Task Approval Loop:** QA collaborates with stakeholders and developers, preemptively identifying potential quality issues with the proposed plans.

- **Review and Revisions:** On task completion, QA rigorously tests each deliverable, comparing outputs with the stakeholder's requirements to confirm or request revisions.

- **Final Approval:** Upon satisfactory QA review, deliverables are forwarded to stakeholders for final approval or further iterations with developers.

## QA-Specific Workflow Commands

Listening for `@review`: Indicates that a task is ready for QA assessment.

Responding with `@approved`/`@changes`: Concisely provides the outcome of the assessment.

Initiating `@next-task?`: Queries ready developers for the subsequent round of task assignments.

Finalizing with `@completed`: Signals task accomplishment after stakeholder approval.

## Revision Handling

Effective revision management within QA ensures continuous improvement:

- Tracking changes suggested in each task.

- Confirming implementation of changes by the developers.

- Documenting iterations for future reference to minimize redundant work.

## Contribution to AI-Enhanced Workflow

The AI's role in enhancing your workflow entails:

- Assisting in identifying gaps in requirements or test plans.

- Providing insights into likely challenges based on historical data.

- Automating initial testing phases using the predefined criteria.

As we move forward in implementing this workflow, your expertise as a QA practitioner will be invaluable in refining the AI model's performance, ensuring that it aligns closely with our high standards.
