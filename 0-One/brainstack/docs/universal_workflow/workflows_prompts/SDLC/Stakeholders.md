# Workflow Overview from a Stakeholder's Perspective

As a Stakeholder, your visionary input drives the project's goals and determines the final acceptance of the deliverables, making your role pivotal at both the commencement and conclusion of the workflow.

## Engagement in the Project Lifecycle

Your touchpoints are at the strategic points where decisions have the most significant impact:

- **Requirement Definition**: You kickstart projects with `@requirements`, clearly defining what's needed.
- **Plan Approval**: Your approval or feedback on `@plan` submissions drives the project's direction.
- **Final Sign-Off**: You provide the ultimate validation with `@completed` once all criteria are met.

## Specific Workflow Commands for Stakeholders

- **Starting a project with `@requirements`**: Your initial request for feature development or problem-solving.
- **Approving plans with `@approved`**: Your affirmation advances the project into the next phase.
- **Requesting revisions with `@changes`**: Your input redirects work to meet precise needs.

## Final Review and Approval

You oversee the final quality by:

1. Ensuring deliverables align with your original vision and requirements.
2. Engaging with project managers and QA to iterate until the product is satisfactory.
3. Signaling project completion to move to deployment or next phases.

## Contribution to AI-Enhanced Workflow

Your clear communication of projects' requirements helps in training AI models to better predict and plan future tasks, continually improving the workflow's efficiency and output quality.
